## Dataset
- **Source**: [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)  
- **Description**:  
  - The dataset contains chest X-ray images labeled as "Pneumonia" and "Normal".  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Resized all images to 128x128 pixels.  
  - Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1].
